I am a passionate Game Developer that loves games and the technical challenges involved in building them. I have more than a decade's worth of experience as a programmer working on games, having worked on a wide array of products that include: free-to-play mobile titles with large DAUs to games running on mall kiosks, and even a sports betting website.

## Oct 2018 - Present, Freelance

### Contract/Collaborations

- **[QYJO](https://qyjo.in/) (Unity/C#):** Developed and programmed a method to generate [random paths](https://medium.com/@1basudevpatel/random-paths-in-gamedev-beatdown-a913a1d8c5e6) for [Gamedev Beatdown](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1100300/Gamedev_Beatdown/).

- **Internal tool for a local consulting company (AWS/Vue-JS):** Hosted on AWS, used a serverless backend for APIs and a static-site created using Vue and hosted on s3.

### Personal Projects

#### Experiments in high-performance game programming (C++)

- Implemented [core match-3 logic](https://github.com/bapel/CodeSomeGames/tree/match3/Match3) as a study in Data-Oriented design, and to serve as a test-bed for experiments, optimizations and tuning
- Ongoing experiments in replacing a subset of the the `std::` library containers and features, primarily to meet the goal of higher performance and simplicity
- Investigation and implementation of faster set/map data-structures with the goal of replacing `std::unordered_set`, `eastl::hash_set` and friends

#### Untitled indie city-building game (Unity/C# - Ongoing)

- Experiments in procedural generation of large aesthetic land-masses, like in anno
- Developed faster methods for generating millions of [poisson sampled disks](https://medium.com/@1basudevpatel/faster-poisson-sampling-a76cb9a99825)
- Implemented algorithms for producing terrain features using a delaunay triangulation of the generated points
- Implemented a performant debug-renderer to visualize millions of points and lines within the Unity editor
- Experiments in using Unity-DOTS for generation, simulation and rendering of the game-world

## Nov 2016 - Oct 2018, Senior Software Engineer at Zynga (Unity/C#)

Worked on gameplay features and performance-optimizations for a 3d mobile strategy game called [Empires and Allies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT-J99zNf_w).

- Implemented AI, Effects and Logic for many units
- Revamped the UI sub-system to support the iPhone-x and other notched screens
- Proposed and worked with team-mates on multiple performance optimizations to reduce memory-usage and improve frame-rates across devices
- Proposed and implemented a tool for artists to streamline recording in game footage for trailers 

## Sep 2012 - Nov 2016, Software Engineer II at Electronic Arts (C++, Unity/C#, Adobe Flash)

Worked as an individual contributor on multiple projects. Work included implementing gameplay features and some specialized technical work.

- **Tetris Blitz (C++):** Short tenure working on improvements to load times
- **Monopoly Slots (Unity/C#):** Earlier an Adobe AIR client that was ported to Unity. Halved load-times and improved frame-rate on the Unity SKU. Load times were halved by moving all XML assets to Google's FlatBuffer. The transition was accomplished bug-free using a tool I wrote that parsed all xml assets and figured out their schema and generated code for xml-to-FlatBuffer-to-runtime and other variations automagically
- **Monopoly Bingo (Unity/C#), Theme Park (C++), Sims Social (Adobe AIR/Flash):** Gameplay Programmer

## Other experience

- **Jan 2012 - Sep 2012, Contract Work (Cocos2d/C++):** Mobile game
- **Aug 2010 - Jan 2012, RZ2 Games (PHP/Android):** Full-stack engineer on a sports betting site
- **Feb 2010 - Aug 2010, Lecturer at ICAT:** Taught a course in math for games and a course in graphics porgramming using Direct3D 9.0c
