# Introduction
---
This is a tutorial for Direct3D 11 that uses CMake and Visual Studio 2019. We will be using SDL as our platform abstraction layer. The tutorial assumes the reader is comfortable with C++ and is familiar with Visual Studio. The steps listed in this tutorial should work for an older Visual Studio, like 2017 also. All the necessary CMake is covered but not in great depth.

Before proceeding you may want to download and install [Visual Studio 2019 community edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/). Make sure to select the *Desktop Development with C++* workload. This will install [CMake tools for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019). If you already have Visual Studio 2019 installed make sure to install the correct workload by selecting *Tools > Get Tools and Features...*
